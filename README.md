## 🛡️ The OSI Model

**Room:** [The OSI Model — TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/osimodelzi)  
**Status:** ✅ Completed  
**Date:** 17 April 2025

### 🎯 Objective
Learn about the seven layers of the OSI Model and how data moves through a network.  
Understand how each layer plays a role in communication between devices.

---

### 🗝️ Key Concepts
- OSI Model – A 7-layer framework that explains how data is sent, received, and understood over a network.
- Encapsulation – The process of adding data at each OSI layer before sending it to another device.
- Layer 1: Physical – Hardware and electrical signals used for sending raw bits (e.g. ethernet cables).
- Layer 2: Data Link – Adds MAC addresses for physical delivery of packets.
- Layer 3: Network – Handles routing using IP addresses to reach the right destination.
- Layer 4: Transport – Manages reliable or fast delivery using TCP (reliable) or UDP (fast but unreliable).
- Layer 5: Session – Manages sessions or connections between devices.
- Layer 6: Presentation – Translates, encrypts, or formats data for the application.
- Layer 7: Application – The top layer where users interact with apps (e.g. browsers, email clients).

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- OSI Dungeon Game – Used to test your understanding by putting layers in the right order.

---

### ⚠️ Challenges Faced
- Remembering the order of the 7 layers was tricky at first.
- Creating real-world examples for each layer helped it click.

---

### 🧠 What I Learned
- I now understand how data moves step-by-step through a network using the OSI model.
- I can match protocols (like TCP, UDP, DNS) to the right OSI layers.

---

### 🌐 Real-World Application:
> Knowing the OSI model helps troubleshoot network problems — for example, checking if the issue is physical (Layer 1), or with an app (Layer 7).  
> Penetration testers and network engineers use this knowledge to identify where data might be exposed or blocked.

---

### 💭 Reflections:
- The layered breakdown made a big topic much easier to digest.
- The dungeon game was a fun way to test knowledge quickly.
- I'll always remember TCP vs UDP — especially thinking about the cat picture example!
